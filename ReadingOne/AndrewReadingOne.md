For Tuesday February 2nd, please read pages 1-6 of Digital Performance and post a response to the github repository in the form of a new document in the folder ReadingOne. You can find the book at this link: [Digital Performance](https://chtodelat.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DixonDigitalPerformance.pdf)

Please write a paragraph to a page (200-600 words) discussing the article and what you think about Digital Performance and New Media Art. It's always a good idea to cite sources in Chicago format(1) and try to cite the specific artist or projects that you are interested in. I also encourage you to incorporate images and gif's to further bolster your arguments.

If you have any questions or concerns technically or conceptually feel free to contact me: andrew.blanton@sjsu.edu or come to office hours at Art 311 from 11-12 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
