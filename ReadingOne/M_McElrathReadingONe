Reading 1

	I thought the reading was very interesting. Being in this major, I have known about digital performance, but I have never experienced 
  it before. I know they had one at San Jose a year or two ago. I think digital performances are really innovative and definitely add to
  the performing arts. I feel like especially in this generation, that the performers and digital arts working together would grab people's
  attention. One thing that Dixon brought to light was using Virtual Reality to do performances and that was something that I had never
  thought of. The idea of using VR to perform something gets me really excited and I feel like now with the recent growth of VR, it is
  even easier to do. Another thing I liked in Dixon’s reading was when he was discussing Lev Manovich and how he disagrees with him to a 
  point. Dixon quotes,
	“...to say, as Manovich does, that the Web is the greatest hypertext work is to propose the theater building as the greatest piece of theater, since that is where the finest performances can-or may, at some time, perhaps-be staged.” (Dixon, Digital Performance, 6.)
	Just because some of the greatest artists work may come out of a program like doesn’t mean that the program is the greatest piece of
  artwork. It’s about the “content” and I don’t believe that Dixon was being too harsh on Manovich. There needs to be a balance of 
  appreciation for the technology and art.
