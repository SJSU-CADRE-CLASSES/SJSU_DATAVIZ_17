Through reading the introduction of Digital performance, I have a deep understanding of digital performance. Actually, in my country, this kind of performances are not usually considered as art. Artists seldom hold a special performance of digital acting, advanced technology are often used in TV programs, singer concerts for their stage effect as a tool. However, as the author said “computer technologies played a dynamic and increasingly important role in live theater, dance, and performance.”(1) I think digital performance will become a trend for future performances.

The author gives several examples of artists performances which show the digital performance expression form is diverse, and he concludes a definition of “digital performance” which “include all performance works where computer technologies play a key role rather than a subsidiary one in content, techniques, aesthetics, or delivery forms.”(3) I agree with his opinion, but sometimes I think it is hard to distinguish a performance mainly use computer technology or art acting, a good digital performance should be the perfect combination of technology and art, unnecessary to distinguish deliberately which take larger proportion.

As for the “technology versus content” issue, I disagree that explain “computer technology should be seen merely a means to an end, not an end in itself.” or “more of a bridge than a destination.” Technology can be the part of art, I think it depends on the individual style and personal preference. Some digital performance seems no content, or create nothing new, making people feel just for showing the technology. But at least these performances give audience an unique and unprecedented experiences. New technology can give the traditional artwork new feelings.

Many performance arts won’t give the audience an result, while art produced in their process, the most important is the thought. Or some art is even insignificance like Dadaism. Art is always tolerant, the same as new media art.
