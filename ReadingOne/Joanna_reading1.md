I have read "Digital Performance" by Steven Dixon

The reading is many trying to express more deeply about artists concerns with the idea of recycling work and remixing pieces within their culture. The beginning of the reading expresses the larger variety we have with performance; having the internet to bring people together to create a huge piece, it has also cause us to do more digital effects and motion within the performance. There are less and less humans involve within the production, more of just a few humans programming a piece to be a certain way. 
One quote I really like from the reading is " The World Wide Web is a site of therapeutic catharsis-overload, and it constitutes the largest theater in the world, offering everyone fifteen megabytes of fame (4)."

One could really see it now, everyone posts their stories or drama on the interweb to gain reaction, as if they were performers in a piece. Or as some (me as well) do, they would put up a persona or a characteristic to start a narrative. 

Less and less people have "original" content, so they refer to the technology to make their content more "new". It tends to be entertaining on a certain sense, but one could see that it has been overused a lot. 

For example, Japanese had been using holograms for projection mapping to create one of their famous mascot, Hatsune Miku. It was then a norm to use these artificial models to do certain activities online. There are so much MikuMikuDance(MMD) on the interweb that no one is surprise to see these hand rigged pieces.

However, there are less and less hand created pieces within these technology, most just rig the models off popular sites or games; while it is fun and entertaining to watch, there is just the question of : is this an artistic content or is it just an endless loop of recycling good content until it became bad?

To be an artist is not to recreate content off a same publisher, but create a content that could engage and make people think. While the author of the paper seem to not like Manovich's approach, I think that it is fine if people enjoyed it. The main point of Manovich's approach is to make people think, even if his work is "recycled", we all know that, and that's why it makes it so fun.
