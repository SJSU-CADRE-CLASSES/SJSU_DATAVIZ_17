  The first critical thing that popped up in my mind is Adrien and Claire’s performance and data visualization artwork that was held in Paris, Cinematique. As technology emerges in artistic ways, many tools were brought into a huge action. Now, technology and art can be a great fusion; once it combines, it became a digital art. From author’s point of view, the author is trying to define the modern technological tools for artists as well as to familiarize the main ingredients for digital art. It is somewhat similar to Adrien and Claire’s work, technological tools for digital artists combined with performing arts. From their work, the author claimed that networking and communication are all connected to new media art. Personally, I found this article interesting and similar to Adrien and Claire’s work of “new media art”, somehow he defined the media art is using diverse amount of technology to recreate the vibrance of visual effects and artistic details. Upon their work, technology and projection mapping would be no difference of visual and new media art. The action of their piece filled with complexity of aesthetics, databases, and computer networks. I would definite agree that Adrien and Claire’s work explicitly define what is “new media art” in an insightful way through a complex lens of digital visualization art.
