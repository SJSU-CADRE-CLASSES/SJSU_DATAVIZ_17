In the article, Steve Dixson talks about how Digital media is increasingly being incorporated into live performances in postmodern times, 
and gives examples of practitioners of this artform and how it varies or evolves with each artist. In my opinion, digital performance 
and New Media art are styles of art that uses computer technology to enhance the experience or improve the quality of the work that is 
being presented. Artworks made from a computer-based medium can often be interactive and participatory, and has the ability to utilize
multiple sensory aspects including touch, sound, and sight at once. They also have the capacity to go beyond the realm of reality into 
virtual reality, altering the perspective of the audience.
One of the specific performance art the author mentioned was choreographed dances made with computers. The idea of using visual 
projections of dancers creating through motion capturing and advanced animation programing is very interesting to me because it 
makes use of what real physical actions and alters it into something imaginary. Artists he suggests includes Yacov Sharir and 
Merce Cunningham.
