New media technologies have had a remarkable impact on art performances in ways that somewhat these technologies have become crucial in the performances rather than the stories, content and aesthetics being the focal point. Subsequently, the content of digital performances is being created through the digitality. Is it likely that we are sacrificing the core and essence of our own artworks by technology?   
 
In the overview of “Digital Performance”, Steve Dixon is discussing the influence of digital technology on theater performances. In that event, theater nowadays has turned into creative experimentations for computing developments. By providing the history of digital performance, he proves that theater has become a mixture of disciplines including VR, online live web collaborations within shows on stage, design softwares, etc. Dixon brings up his point of view on how technology improvement is changing the definition of art. He also mentions how art, science and technology are all potentially being cut down into one field as a whole. 
 
Digital and interdisciplinary art practices capture my interest in many ways. I am drawn to the possibilities in various projects that I can create using different mediums. Coming from a less related background, I have not been exposed to many new media artists but I have been going to Tehran Annual Digital Art Exhibition **(TADAEX)**[(1)](http://www.tadaex.com/2016/about/) since 2013. There I have met with artists and seen their artworks/performances in person. One of the works that made me wish I was a new media artist myself was by Nasim Biyarjomandy titled **Mutual Respect**[(2)](https://vimeo.com/93376794/). Using two boxes of light sensitive to sound, she tries to represent how people's communication should be like.
