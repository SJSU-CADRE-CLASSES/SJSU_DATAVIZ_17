In page 1-6 of the article Digital Performance by Steve Dixon, he introduced some concept and examples of Digital Performance and New Media Art. 
According to Mr. Dixon’s statement, digital performance can be any performance that computer plays a key role. Benefit from the huge amount of internet users, digital performance become a very huge but general concept that happening in today’s world. As a result, to my opinion, digital performance is more like a community behavior, but not a skill that belongs to engineer or artist. Today, we can easily find creative ideas that performanced by various of people on the social network like Facebook or Twitter. Different with traditional artist, an artist who study in Digital Media Art is kind sharing the skills with community. At the sametime, the media, or the technology, are developing all the time with a frightening speed. The “New Media” is an active subject: it relies on the current moment. 
So, what is the goal to the New Media Artist? I have this question because making art should be different from general purpose. An ideal performance in my mind is one can repackage the developing technology, or explore new usage and perspective of the current or even old technologies.
