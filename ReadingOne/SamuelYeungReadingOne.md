Digital performance is a strange category. Steve Dixon writes about it from the viewpoint of theater and describes it as the point where the digital aspects of a play take a major role on stage. With the many theatrical productions incorporate digital mediums, it is quite difficult to put this definition to use. Would productions with electronic music be considered digital performance? Music is a major component of a play, but it is usually considered a background element. Dixon's example of performers being projected on the screen resembles that of films, but are those also considered digital performances? Unless there is computer generated content, a film is quite similar to a recording. There could be years of editing behind a film, but it may not take that “key role” as a digital performance. The internet could be called a stage for digital performance, seeing how people tend to change in an anonymous environment. However, the focus tends to fall upon the actors and not the programs used. Interactive works like video games are probably the closest to digital performances as it is difficult to ignore the medium. As Dixon writes, the idea that there is nothing new under the sun is foolish. Ideas develop out of older iterations, but the developments themselves are still new. The end result may exceed the components from which it was created.
