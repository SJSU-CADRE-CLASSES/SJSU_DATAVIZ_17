The article introduces us to the increasing roles of computer technologies in "live theatre, dance, and performance".
This includes the use of the internet, computers, and projectors to create real-time digital performances or a mix with the live
performances of actors. This creates a whole new medium of performance and increases the medium of digital performances. The increase
sees the use of projectors and digital video in projection mapping, and the use of digital software in installation pieces. This 
unsurprising rise in use of technology creates real and genuinely new avenues of art; though I am sure that eventually that everything even 
in the digital world will be recycled and reused. 

Personally, I like the inclusion of rising technology in performing arts. It creates a new medium. It enables artists to create environ-
ments that aren't limited to a stage set. Not only performing arts but even in projection mapping; it gives life to a life-
less object. It creates a spectacle of lights that leaves its viewers in awe. It requires a visual artists that can take in the unique quirks 
of architecture to create the unexpected. Light that was once used as a tool because a piece of art and thats interesting. Light can evoke emotion
and response from people. I personally am interested in the use of light in art. How people interact and recieve light. So you can say I am 
highly interested in the use of new media and computer technologies in art.
