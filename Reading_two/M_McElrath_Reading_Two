	The article  “A Conversation on Concrete Music and Kinetic Art” was a very interesting and unusual article. Unusual as in it actually
  is a conversation between Frank J. Malina and Pierre Schaeffer. They begin talking about what is concrete music and how it is different
  from classical music. Once they discuss the definition of concrete music, they delve into deeper topics. One of them being the
  correlation between images and audio and for most part that most audio pairs well with any set of images. For the most part, 
  I agree with this view.They also went into a little bit about their work and how people ask about what process they take to make it.
  It was very interesting read how unwilling and annoyed they got about sharing their process, which I feel is unusual for an artist. 
  Towards the end though I got kind of lost about what they were talking about. Overall I enjoyed reading this article and their views
  on the relations between images and sound.
