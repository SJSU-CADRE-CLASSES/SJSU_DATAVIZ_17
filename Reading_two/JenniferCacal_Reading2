In A Conversation on Concrete Music and Kinetic Art, Malina and Schaeffer discuss the relationship between sound and visual practice. One thing I found interesting about the article was when Schaeffer discuss the difference between sound produced by musical instruments and human sounds and sound produced by noises. The way he describes how when we listen to violin music, we imagine the violinist moving his fingers and bow. We know where the sound is coming from and how it is made. However, sounds from a synthesizer are noises produced via machine when set at a certain frequency. There is really not motions to go along with the sound or visual aid to it so our listening is more, in their words, inductive rather than deductive. Sounds not naturally made are considered foreign because sound produced has no exact origin. It’s interesting how sound can have such a strong visual idea attached to it that you may not need a visual aid to imagine, for example, violins playing.
It’s also interesting how they mention that audio is also all about aesthetics. Music reinforces the image, for example, when a picture of an eclipse is shown, the note ‘la’ is played. There is no connection between the two, but one is made based on the interpretation of the audience. It changes the experience of the image, and now, when you look at a eclipse, her hear the sound ‘la’ in your head.
On another note, I liked how they related math to electronically produced sounds, for example, octaves correspond to the powers of two, harmonics are like the set of integers, the cycle of fifths refers to the tempered musical scale.
