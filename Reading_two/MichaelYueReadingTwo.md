	After reading "A Conversation on Concrete Music and Kinetic Art" the author suggested a heavy opinion on digital music and art, which is part of computational creativity. I support with the author's point, digital music and kinetic art, the main point that I will criticize is that digital music and art correlates to human voice as well as to implement digital sound effects.  From my opinion, artificial human voice is made through synthesizers and there is no difference between acoustics and digital music. However, it can also create art; that is, digital imaging with utilizing sound waves and generate a random remixed digital image. I think that digital and kinetic music is something that people must cherish during this modern technological age. I would very appreciate with new technological resources like DAW and other music producers would generate digial and kinetic music art through computational creativity. I would suggest there is computational creativity, but it can develop more through digital programming as well as telecommunication tools.  This reading really took the stance of the way how kinetic art is viewed through lens of different types of people about how and what they feel about it.
