I read the story of Elijah for the musical performance later in the month. The whole story is about the prophet Elijah and his suffering for his people of Israel. I wonâ€™t talk about the story much because I got the gist of it by reading the talking and the synopsis, but I do like the story for its human nature. The imagery I have for story makes me thought about the style of art and aesthetics I might create for the show, which is more on a calming golden land turning more and more dark as people became more distrusting of their own religion and the people around them. Like an innocent kid being muddled by the dark satire of human society. I am interested in listening to the piece however; the story itself gave me an imagery and a sound, but having it transfer totally into a classical piece would switch up the taste a lot more. In total, I am looking forward to creating visuals for this huge project.
