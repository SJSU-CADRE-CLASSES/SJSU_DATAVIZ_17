	Mendelssohn's Elijah follows the story of the prophet. He warns King Ahab of God's displeasure at the king's worship of Baal. The drought was God's punishment and would not be lifted until the King repents. Elijah challenges the priests of Baal to have their god light an offering, but they fail and his prayers manage to light the offering instead. He then calls for the people to slay the priests of Baal before praying for an end to the drought. Jezebel retaliated by claiming that Elijah was the source of the drought and riled up the people to murder him. Elijah fled to the wilderness and was eventually taken to heaven in a fiery chariot.
  
	It is a fairly typical story for those of the Abrahamic religions. After seeing the performance, I feel that the visuals could have been changed to be somewhat more representational for the section that they are in. It is difficult to understand the singing half the time and visuals could have helped clarify the story for those lost portions. However, this would draw attention from the performers, so they may not appreciate such visuals. The visuals did not feel very unified as there were many different styles from one scene to the next, although some may view this as a strength.
