Three Artist Assignment
--------------------------------

Hi all and Welcome! For Tuesday please research and find three artists that you are interested in and push your response to the git repo. Please write a paragraph to a page (200-600 words) discussing why you like these artist and why their work interest you.

It's always a good idea to cite sources in Chicago format([1](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)) and try to cite the specific artist or projects that you are interested in. I also encourage you to incorporate images and gif's to further bolster your arguments.

In your response feel free to discuss the artist that you are interested in([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whitney_(filmmaker))), conceptually why you are interested in their work([3](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/digital-performance)), and any other ideas you feel relevant for discussion([4](https://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/)). Try to think critically about ways that projection and visualization can be used as a medium. You might also want to discuss how your own practice fits into or does not fit into live visuals.
