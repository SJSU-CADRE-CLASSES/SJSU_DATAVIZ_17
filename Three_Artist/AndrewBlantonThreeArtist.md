Three Artist Assignment
------------------------

Hi all and Welcome! For Tuesday please research and find three artist that you are interested in and push your response to the git repo. Please write a paragraph to a page (200-600 words) discussing why you like these artist and why their work interest you.

It's always a good idea to cite sources in Chicago format([1](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)) and try to cite specific artist or projects that you are interested in. I also encourage you to incorporate images and gif's to further bolster your arguments.

In your response feel free to discuss artist that you are interested in([2](http://matter.media.mit.edu/publications/article/grown-printed-and-biologically-augmented)), concepts that you are interested in([3](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/28148)), or any other ideas you feel relevant for discussion([4](http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertszczerba/2015/06/17/no-donor-required-5-body-parts-you-can-make-with-3-d-printers-2/#4d1189c14a3b))([5](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/jan/25/3d-print-chocolate-face-valentines-day)). Try to think critically about ways that 3D printers can be used and what their broad impact on creative processes might be. You might also want to discuss how your own practice fits into or does not fit into the industrial pipeline of 3D content generation.
