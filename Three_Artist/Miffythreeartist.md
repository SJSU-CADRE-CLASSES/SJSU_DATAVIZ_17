The three VJ artists that I like:

1.Bot&Dolly

Bot and Dolly are the members of The Creators Project which is a global celebration of creativity, arts and technology. They mainly use projection-mapping to create their works. And I really like one of their live show named Box. It only use two boards, simple geometric figures, but shows strong sense of space. The video is only black and white, making the frame clear and technologic. And I also like their performing form which interacting with the boards, as an audience, I feel exploring in the combination of real and digital space and make me believe he really go through the digital space.

2.Anthony Francisco Schepperd

Anthony Franscisco Schepperd is an animator, but I think his video combine the music and rhythm very well. Because he is an animator, he can create any characters he want, and transform them into another smoothly. The characters transfer between reality and abstract freely. So his work won't limited by the materials, the content is not only graph, symbol or light, but also some characters, stuff and animals. His video is creative and even can tell us a story. I think his work bring us to a fancy cartoon world.

3.Jack Hattingh

Jack Hattingh is a director who is multi-talented, he is a pioneer in the field of 3D Architectural mapping. And I like this building projection which is a new movie "The Tourist" promotion. I think this art show is very creative and attracting. It combines music, video and animation which make the building change to another scenery, and feeled really moved. The projection also add some element of the movie, like the architectural style, train, gunfight, showing the mainly content to the audience. And I think the music also relate to the movie, more brightly at the begining, tense in the middle and happy in the end, which imply the plot of the movie.
