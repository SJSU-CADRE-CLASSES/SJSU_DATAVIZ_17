The 3 artists that I really like their visual effects:

1. Okiku

Okiku is part of the band REOL, where it consist of Reol being the vocal, music and arranged chorus by Giga, and Okiku being the movie editor and design creation.
Before this band was form, these 3 people would always work together to create or remix certain music pieces. With Reol being one of my top favorite female japanese singers, 
I would watch her videos alot and be extremely pleased with the way the video and aesthetic work so well with the music. Okiku's work tend to change depending on the music piece 
she would work on. However, it is very aesthetically pleasing.

2. Raphael Arar

This person is my art 105 professor. On friday last week we met him for the first time, and saw his work. One of the piece that really caught my attention was the Forbidden Pixel(2015).
A performance piece that was played at El Camino COllege Plaetarium, it includes several eye catching effects and reality bending techniques. While not all of his work is on that scale
of hugeness, he still dealt an ample amount of visual work.

3. OBSCURA

I saw this website during art 105, where it was mostly showing the works that the OBSCURA team did. While I wasn't sure if a team would be qualify in this requirements, their performance pieces
are very beautiful and well known through out many large scale companies. The piece I like the most is the one done on SF city hall. I grew up within San Francisco, and the city hall is really one of the best
places I like to see. In total, their work is beautiful and detailed and I wish I could go see it in person some day.
