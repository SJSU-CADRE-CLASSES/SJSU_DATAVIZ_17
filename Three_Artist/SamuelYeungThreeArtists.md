ANTIVJ is a group that works with projection mapping. Their works are usually created to be projected on buildings, but Dry Lights(1) is instead projections on an imagined desert landscape. I found it an interesting twist on the norm and wonder how powerful projectors would have to be for this feat. A landscape makes for a very large canvas with any irregularities that the artists have to account for when creating the projections. I imagine that attempting this in an actual desert would require a fairly substantial budget with drones to project from above.<br>

Bot & Dolly created Box(2), which is smaller scale projection mapping compared to ANTIVJ, but equally interesting. Box is projections on moving surfaces with two panels where their magic tricks happen. I had been quite baffled by the tricks when I first watched it, and can still appreciate the effort that went into the project despite being aware of their tricks.<br>

Nobumichi Asai created an interesting project with Omote. This projection is upon a model's face and changes her appearance. The shift are subtle at first, but get quite drastic after the initial tests. She ends up looking like an alien after shedding a robotic skin. They show a few of their experimental projections afterwards with an attempt to replicate reflections of the surroundings on her face. This piece is less refined than the two above, but reveals the process of their work.<br>
