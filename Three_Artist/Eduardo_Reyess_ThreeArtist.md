Three Artists 


Patrice Warrener

I came across the work of this artist when researching artists that work with Project mapping and other similar works. Patrice Warrener is a French light artist who has specialized in creating “Chromolithe” art, which is a light art that gives the impression that buildings have been painted on with glowing colors. Warrener’s installations have been created for several buildings including a variety of historic public buildings, museums, churches and even banks. Additionally, Warrener has also worked with several music artists to create installations for their shows, such as his partnership with electronic music legend Tim Blake. Thanks to several of his works, Patrice warrener has influenced the increase of popularity on many cities for this type of art.
