Three Artists 


Patrice Warrener

I came across the work of this artist when researching artists that work with Project mapping and other similar works. Patrice Warrener is a French light artist who has specialized in creating “Chromolithe” art, which is a light art that gives the impression that buildings have been painted on with glowing colors. Warrener’s installations have been created for several buildings including a variety of historic public buildings, museums, churches and even banks. Additionally, Warrener has also worked with several music artists to create installations for their shows, such as his partnership with electronic music legend Tim Blake. Thanks to several of his works, Patrice warrener has influenced the increase of popularity on many cities for this type of art.

Most of his works emanates from inspirations of the history of art, as well as several other themes that occur in the world this includes nature, flows and networks, virtual cities and ornate designs. Chevalier uses computer technology to create his works of art and has had a major influence on this type of art, to make it what it is today. Miguel has produced installations for galleries, art centers, museums, and public spaces around the world. Some of his works are projected on large scale, shown on Leds screen or LCD screen, as well as sculptures created by the artist, for that purpose.

Much of his works revolves around site-specific public art in which he embeds his style of live audio/visual performance. His works aims to explore the space among digital and physical entities, he does this by creating a mix relationship between architecture and media art.
