-Leo Villareal

I really enjoy Leo Villareal's work. His work is composed of installations that implement LED lights. One of his notable works that everyone in the Bay Area should atleast know about is the Bay Lights on the Bay Bridge. He created randomly generating visuals that implement the thousands of LED's constructed onto the bridge. It creates a spectacle for any to see in the area and makes a bridge more than a bridge. Not only is it something that you can appreciate for its use but also as an object to view.

Ben Cline is more of a designer. He creates layouts and designs that are more applicable to User Interface and User Experience. From mobile concepts to full website concepts. They could be used simply for creating a cool interface or creating a fun and interactive way of displaying real time information. I really like the work he produces and aim to create similiar works. All these artists are inspirational to me. The things that they all create are things I inspire to learn and be able to create myself.

He has created projection mapping works which could be seen online. His works are awe inspiring and bring to life lifeless objects. The illusions and creations he can produce are second to none. Projection mapping is always interesting because the many applications and uses for it.
