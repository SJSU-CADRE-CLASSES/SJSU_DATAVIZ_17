Three Artists

1. [Jen Lewin]
Jen Lewin is a large interactive stallation artist based in New York City. 
Most of her projects utilizes lights and sounds in the public space, which is one of the reasons I like her work. 
Anyone is free to interact and appreciate with the installations, and a lot of her projects have a very whimsical quality to them. 
Very fun to look at. One of my favorite works of hers is The Pond, exhibited at Luna Fete in New Orleans in 2015.

2. [Kite and Laslett]
Sebastian Kite and Will Laslett are a duo of amazing artists that design works light and sound installations and performances. 
They produce architectural and spatiral environments that can immerse the viewer into a whole new and separate setting that 
can incite imagination and ingenuity. I recommend checking out R E L A Y, 'A leap in the dark' or C A N D E S C E N C E.

3. [Ron Miziker] 
While Miziker is not really an light and sound focused installation artist, he is one of America's foremost showmen, 
having a big influence  in creating major world spectaculars and performances for audiences worldwide. 
He is the producer and directer of one of my favorite sound and light shows of my childhood, Disney's Main Street Electrical Parade.
