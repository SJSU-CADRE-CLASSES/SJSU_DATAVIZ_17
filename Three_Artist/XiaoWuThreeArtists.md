1. Interactive LED Floor by Mediatec group
Mediatec is not an artist, but a business group major in provide technology solutions by using imaging, audio and lighting for different situation, which include events, exhibitions and meetings.
The work I found is an Interactive LED Floor they made on 2010. They are no longer having this piece's information on their website, but I think it is still an amazing piece. In this work, whenever people step on the LED floor, the screen will draw dynamic textures (particles) on people's position. The more active the person is, the more active the particles will be.

2. L'heure cloche by Joëlle Aeschlimann, Pauline Saglio and Mathieu Rivier
Mathieu Rivier is an Swiss artist from University of art and design in Lausanne. He is major in Media and Interaction Design and explored many different media arts.
I believe this is an group work from him. This project is located at a house. At first you will hear the noise of squawking chicken behind a close door. After you open the door, the squawking stops and a lullaby plays with a set of projection on lace curtain.

3. The coughing billboard by Apotek Hjärtat
From What I know, Apotek Hjärtat is a Pharmacy from Solna, Sweden. In the new year of 2017, they make an advertisement with an interactive billboard to ask people to quit smocking.
The billboard have a digital screen with smoke detectors. Whenever people who smoking walk by the billboard, the person stand in the screen will start to cough, which remind them the negative effect that the somking brings to people around them, in a hyperbolical but unexpected way.
