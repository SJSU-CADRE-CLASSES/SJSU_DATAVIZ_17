1. Artists: Adrien M/ Claire B


	Adiren and Claire’s artwork of projection mapping did a great job showing off their complex ideas. It fuses between performance and projection mapping; to me, it is a great success.  These two artists conceptualizes audio, projection, and visual art in a way that they can perform and interact with visual art.  In the artwork of Adrien and Claire, simplicity was completely left behind; and, diverse features in this piece adds on the extension of projection mapping.  These pair of artists contribute to the projection mapping as well as computer vision and UI interface. To me, I enjoyed his artwork with interactive virtual reality.

2. Aaron Koblin

   After watching few seconds of Koblin’s artwork, Colors. The VFX produced a detail in networking colors traveling down different path. I enjoyed his work because I appreciate the value of computer algorithm that generates colors and effects to show air traffic network to visualize an art.  Aaron did an outstanding job to manipulating data sources to portray a complex communication. Koblin’s work, Flight of Colors were wired with immense amount of networking systems and made it lightly complicated, not actually pleasing towards some audiences.   From the data communication,  the simplicity in its features did not express clearly about the visual effects as well as lacking of many features.






3. Refik Anadol

	This artists did their work based on projection mapping. Personally, I enjoyed their work because their idea was insightful, and extended his researched data and visualized in an artistic way.  These three artists made an achieving accomplishment on how they used data of data visualization and then modeled into a form of mapping. In my opinion, Koblin’s artwork filled with simplicity (just lines and colors), but the complex streaming of path triggered unique visual effects. From my viewpoint, Adrien and Claire’s artwork declined in simplicity, adds on the complex fusion of performance and video projection mapping that added to my interest.
