Sofles- This artist drew a graffiti art on a side of the building and teamed up with a designer named Grant Osborne to do projection mapping. I really like what Sofles did with the the graffiti artwork and making the art work come to life with the projection mapping done by Osoborne.

Skullmapping- This artist used a small art gallery to do his projection mapping where he had a monkey run around the whole art gallery space chasing a person. I think this is one of the coolest projection mapping I have seen where the art work actually comes alive and makes the whole art gallery into an artwork. I want to be able to do something like this one day because this was a really interesting piece of projection mapping that has inspired me to make a projection mapping based art work.

Chika Shikaku- One of her artworks Shikaku 04 is a projection mapping where the art work reacts to its environment. The audio and the lights of the projection mapping changes according to its environment and I think this is one of the most interesting part of her art work. Audience who are observing the installation becomes part of her art work too. Each experience is different depending on the audience because the projection mapping adapts to its environment.
