The three artist that I really like are Andrew Hussie, Sparth and Feng Zhu. These artist are the  three that currently inspire me the most.
Andrew Hussie is a artist/writer. What he is known for is the webcomic called Homestuck. It is considered a webcomic, but it also has 
puzzles, minigames and animations in it. What I really like about him is that he is an artist, but he is able to come with really complex
and deep stories. His animations are also really awesome and it is really amazing that he worked on it by himself for the majority of the 
five years that it was running. The next artist that I really like is Sparth. He is an artist in the video game industry. He is currently 
working as the Art director for Halo 5 and he’s worked on their previous ips as well. He does a lot of work in the science fiction genre
and creates really unique illustrations. Even though they are held in the futuristic sci-fi realm, the subject matter still makes logical 
sense and you can see understand what it is based on. The third artist I really like and have been listening and watching the most of is 
Feng Zhu. He is a concept artist and works mostly in the video game industry. Currently he is residing in Singapore where his school is 
located. There he is the Art Director. What I like about him is that he is one of the few concept artist that puts out videos and podcasts
with advice to aspiring artists. I’ve been watching his videos for about a year and I have learned a lot about the field that I am
interested. Looking at his art I have learned a lot about what it takes to be a concept artist. These three are my favorite artist and I 
hope someday I can get somewhere close to their level.
