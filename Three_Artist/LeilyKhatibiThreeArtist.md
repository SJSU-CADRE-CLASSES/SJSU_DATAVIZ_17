### 1. Neuroscape Lab
**[Project: "Real-Time Visualization Of Electrical Activity In The Brain"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sz-l6RDrvU&feature=youtu.be)**

This real-time visualization depicts the electrical activity of the brain. I am amazed by how this visualization helps make understanding scientific phenomena more simple by connecting neuroimaging technologies to 3D computer imagery. Driven from MRI brain scans, Inside the glassbrain structure there are various lights and colors portraying dynamic brain networks and their interactions.

Muti Randolph is a Multimedia Artist creating real-time interactive installation visualizations. What I love most about his artworks is the use of space. The sets he creates are a mixture of different disciplines: architecture, audio, light, ... He has designed a number of dance floors, runways and show sets by creating a connection between 2D and 3D structures in real-time.


### 3. Jason Sigal
