GRIDSPACE: Canada based VJs they do a lot of panorama displays. These guys like to work huge.  They have a dark kinda gothic sci-fi style, they have done work for Budweiser, Cirque de Soleil, and Igloofest to name a few. They work loud and big and create an immersive experience.  

U-matic:  German base group take actual footage and pixel renders the images. They work rather large but they are far more interactive with their audience. Their images are simplified and geometric, reminds me of original recipe Tron.

Anti-VJ: These guys are awesome, they work in massive installations. They are a collective group with a few core members, and do so much cool stuff. Anti-VJ does a lot of projection mapping and when the project they take over and transform a space.
